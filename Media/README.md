This is a mobile application for students and faculty to sign up to view school events and be notified when an upcoming event is changed or is close to the start time.

The purpose of this app is location specific, therefore, if you are outside of the location this app was designed for, it will most likely not preform to the best of its ability.

--CHANGING SPORT LIST IN SIGN UP PAGE FORM--
When the seasons change and therefore, the sports for the sign ups change, you can do that easily. There is an "Edit" button in the lower right hand corner on the Sign Up page. Once clicked, you will be prompted to enter the administrative password. After the password has been verified, another window will pop up asking for a season to be displayed. Type in the desired season(lower and upper case does not matter) and hit "OK". The program automatically knows which sports are during which season and will display the sports for the desired season you chose.

Thank you for taking the time to read this.
