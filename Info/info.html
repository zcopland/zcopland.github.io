	 <p id="header" class="noSelect">Developers</p>
	 	<p class="noSelect">This app was developed by Edward Little alumni: Zach Copland, Noah Perron, and Kyle Romero.</p>

	 <p id="header" class="noSelect">myEddies</p>
	 	<p class="noSelect"> The purpose of this app was to get rid of the need to navigate the ELHS webpage, and have easier access to various features. These features include the ability to have a custom calendar catered to the user, as well as provide for a place to sign up for various activities without the need of using paper sign ups. There are also useful links that most students have a hard time finding(i.e. Printing app).</p>

	 <p id="header" class="noSelect">How to use this app</a>
	 	<p>The first button on the Home page is a Sign In button. This will prompt you to sign in with Google.com and then, right below the title, will either be an A or a B, this indicates what day it <strong>currently</strong> is in school. <br>
	 		The first button, will bring you to a set of sport/activity buttons. Clicking them adds that particular sport/activity to your calendar. Clicking that same button, will remove that sport/activity off your calendar. Clicking on My Calendar, will show you in a list view all of the upcoming events within the school year. If you have more questions, there is a Help button at the button of the page which shows you more information on the sports/activities.<br>
	 		The second button, will take you to the Sign Up page. This page is for sport/activity sign ups. Fill out all the fields and submit the form to sign up for the designated sport/activity. Submitting the form, sends the information to a spreadsheet that only the administrators can access. Administrators: to change the season on the page, click the Edit button in the lower right hand corner, then enter the password that has been already provided, and finally, enter the season you would like displayed.<br>
	 		The fourth button, brings you to a page with useful links. The links are: the ELHS website, PowerSchool, the Printer App, the Student Handbook, Lunch Menus, LRTC, and provides the district code. If there are any links that should be added, the developers can add another link upon request.
